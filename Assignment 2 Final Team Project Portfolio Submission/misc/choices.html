</ul><h3><p>FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY IN ONLINE EDUCATION <p></h3>
<p><em>“Because of the flexibility of online education, students may take for granted that their online coursework can easily fit into their typical</p></em>
<p><em>schedule.” (Globokar & Lynn, 2010)</p></em>
</ul><h3><p>Flexibility as a Key Feature:  <p></h3>
<p><em>Online education offers flexibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace.  </p></em>
<p><em>Students often find it convenient to integrate online coursework into their daily routines. </p></em>
<p><em>This flexibility enhances accessibility and engagement in learning. </p></em>

</ul><h3><p>Efficiency of Online Learning:  <p></h3>
<p><em>Efficient time management is a hallmark of online education. </p></em>
<p><em>Students save time on commuting and can dedicate more time to coursework.</p></em>
<p><em>This efficient use of time benefits both students and educators. </p></em>
