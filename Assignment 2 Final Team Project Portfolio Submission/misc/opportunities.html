</ul><h3><p>ENHANCING ONLINE LEARNING THROUGH ADAPTABILITY  <p></h3>
<p><em>"Online learning materials should include activities for the different styles, so that learners can select appropriate activities based on </p></em>
<p><em>their preferred learning style." (Anderson, 2011, p. 27)</p></em>
</ul><h3><p>Personalized Learning Experiences:  <p></h3>
<p><em>Learning materials offer a spectrum of activities to cater to varying learning styles.  </p></em>
<p><em>Learners have the freedom to choose activities that resonate with their preferred style.  </p></em>


</ul><h3><p>Fostering Engagement:  <p></h3>
<p><em>Adaptability enhances engagement and participation. p></em>
<p><em>When learners can select activities that align with their learning style, they become more engaged in the learning process.</p></em>
<p><em>Engaged learners are more likely to retain and apply knowledge effectively. </p></em>
